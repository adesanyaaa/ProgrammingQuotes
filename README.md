# ProgrammingQuotes
Uses Retrofit to get quotes from ProgrammingQuotesApi.
Also uses DiffUtil to calculates the difference between two lists and outputs a list of 
update operations that converts the first list into the second one.
This great inspirational and educational API was created by Damjan Pavlica.
